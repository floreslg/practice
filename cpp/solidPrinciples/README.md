# SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Programming
SOLID principles are five principles of class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure. 

- **SRP, Single Responsibility Principle**: a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.
- **OCP, Open/Closed Principle**: classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.
- **LSP, Liskov's Subtitution Principle**: subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **ISP, Interface Segregation Principle**: clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces that they do not use.
- **DIP, Dependency Inversion Principle**:
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
