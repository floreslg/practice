# SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Programming
SOLID principles are five principles of class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure. 

- SRP, Single Responsibility Principle: a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change

- LSP, Liskov's Subtitution Principle: subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- ISP, Interface Segregation Principle: clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces that they do not use.
